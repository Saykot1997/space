# Getting Started with Space App

This project was for getting information about space and rockets.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install` 

To install all the dependency to run the app.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `docker run -p 3000:3000 saykot/space:1.0.0`

I have build docker image and pushed in dockerhub and this is the script to run app in the docker container if the machine has docker install.
